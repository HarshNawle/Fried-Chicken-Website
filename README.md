A responsive restaurant website developed as part of a personal portfolio. The site demonstrates layout techniques, responsive design, and simple interactivity using only HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

## Project Overview

This static site represents a fictional fried chicken restaurant. It includes the following sections:

1. **Home** – hero image with marketing text and call-to-action link
2. **About** – story of the restaurant with supporting images and tooltips
3. **Order** – product cards showing different bucket sizes and prices
4. **Combo** – promotional combo display with animated numbers
5. **Contact** – multiple contact methods with social links and addresses
6. **Footer** – social media icons and subscription form

Animations are powered by [ScrollReveal.js](https://scrollrevealjs.org/).

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 & CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- ScrollReveal for scroll-triggered animations
- Deployed as a static site on [Render](https://render.com)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fried-chicken-website.git
   cd fried-chicken-website/assets
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a browser or serve via a simple HTTP server:
   ```bash
   npx http-server .
   ```
3. The site is responsive and works on desktop and mobile.

## Deployment

Hosted on Render as a static site. The publish directory is set to `assets`, where `index.html` resides. Whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch, Render automatically rebuilds the site.
